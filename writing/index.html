				<h2>The Three of Us<br></h2>
<h3>
<br>
Adam makes himself coffee and sits down at the table.<br>
Carl and Tony walk into the kitchen.<br>
Adam to Tony: “Pour Carl some orange juice.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Fine.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “Don’t forget to give him the red straw this time.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “I didn’t forget last time. I just don’t give two shits whether Carl uses a red or blue straw.”<br>
Carl: “But I like the red straws more.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “Exactly, so give him the red straw this time.”<br>
Tony: “Urgh…fine.”<br>
Carl happily sips on his orange juice.<br>
Tony grabs a bottle of Jack Daniels and starts pouring it into a glass.<br>
Adam to Tony: “You shouldn’t be drinking.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Who says I can’t drink in the morning?”<br>
Adam to Tony: “I didn’t say you shouldn’t drink in the morning. I said you shouldn’t be drinking. Like period. Not until you’re of age at least.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “You’re the one who started drinking so young.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “You did too.”<br>
Carl: “Can I try some?”<br>
Adam and Tony: “NO!”<br>
Silence.<br>
Tony makes pancakes for both him and Carl.<br>
The three boys begin to eat breakfast at the kitchen table.<br>
Tony to Carl: “So Chris grabs three drinks at the bar. One for me, one for him, and one for Alec. Chris is low-key forever in debt to Alec since he let him stay at his place for a month while his mom was MIA. Guess that’s kinda high-key though, but whatever. Anyway, once he gets to the table, a bunch of people show up. Vicky and her girls come through, along with Daniel, Steve, and a bunch of the other boys. Morris, too. You know Morris.”<br>
Carl to Tony: “Yeah, he sucks. Never wants to play Legos with me.”<br>
Tony to Carl: “He’s a good guy, I promise. He’s one of my best friends. Just never liked Legos as a kid.”<br>
Tony to Carl: “Okay, so then a bunch of douchebags follow them in. And you can almost smell the fiendishness sweating out of them from across the room. The second Vicky sits down next to me; she suddenly gets stuck being hit on by one of these douches. Like you can tell Vicky was not okay with the situation.”<br>
Carl to Tony: “Ew gross. So what did you guys do?”<br>
Tony to Carl: “Well obviously we couldn’t let a bunch of fucking assholes make our girl feel uncomfortable. So we shoved him away.”<br>
Carl to Tony: “Woah! What did he do back?”<br>
Tony to Carl: “Well…”<br>
Adam to Tony: “Adam, stop telling Carl these kind of stories. They aren’t fit to be heard by someone his age.”<br>
Carl to Adam: “But I wanna know what happens!”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Exactly. Don’t you want to know what happens too?”<br>
Adam to Tony: “I know what happens. I was there.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Oh, right, of course.”<br>
Tony: “Well anyway, basically, we beat those faggots to a pulp.”<br>
Carl: “So faggots means douchebags?”<br>
Tony and Adam: “No, no, no!”<br>
Adam: “NOT what that means, Carl!”<br>
Adam to Tony: “You see what I mean, Tony! You don’t THINK. You think you think, but you only think about what you want to happen, and force your way to that goal. But that’s not how life works. You can’t just force something to happen, because maybe it won’t happen.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Sounds like you’ve just given up!”<br>
Adam to Tony: “Don’t act like you don’t know what we’re actually fucking talking about here, Tony! Open your fucking eyes! She hates you! She hates everything about you! She sees no redeeming qualities in you whatsoever!”<br>
Silence.<br>
Carl to Tony: “…she doesn’t sound nice, Tony.”<br>
Tony to Carl: “…she isn’t, sometimes.”<br>
Adam to Carl: “No, she’s just confused. Just as confused as Tony.”<br>
Silence.<br>
Adam to Tony: “She isn’t worth it you know?”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Shut up.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “No, you need to hear this. You can’t keep running away from this forever.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “Fine, say whatever you’re going to say. But don’t expect me to care.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “She doesn’t love you back. And you barely love her anyway. You are in love with the idea of her. And you think that idea is enough to make it work but it doesn’t.”<br>
Tony to Adam: “You’re wrong. It is enough. You’ve just forgotten how to love. How to feel any sense of emotion. And again, you’re wrong. I do love her.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “What? Because every time she tells you to roll down your sleeves cuz she thinks it’s silly, you smile? Because you guys can talk for hours about nothing and yet those hours feel like everything? Because when you were feeling down but told no one about it, she brought you orange juice since she knows that’s your favorite?”<br>
Carl: “Orange juice huh? She sounds pretty cool.”<br>
Tony to Carl: “She IS pretty cool.”<br>
Adam to Tony: “Because when she hurt you, she found the time to say ‘I’m sorry’? Because she knows every little detail about you and no one seems to get you like her? Because she said I love you before you said it to her so she must mean it?<br>
Tony to Adam: “…what’s your point?”
Adam to Tony: “What’s my point? Tony…she hates when you roll up your sleeves, but YOU like doing it. You guys don’t talk for hours, she does. She brought you orange juice because she felt guilty and hated feeling guilty, not because she cared…”
Tony to Adam: “…please stop…”<br>
Adam to Tony: “…she found time to say sorry? She hurt you, Tony. Real bad. She knows every detail about you so she can have full control…and she doesn’t love you, Tony…she just…”
<br>Tony to Adam: “…SHUT THE FUCK UP ADAM!”
<br>Tony throws his glass of Jack at Adam, but it misses and shatters on the floor.
<br>Tony slowly walks over to the shattered glass and begins to clean up.
<br>Adam walks over to Tony and begins to help clean up.
<br>Silence.
<br>Tony to Adam: “Remember when mom brought us to the zoo.”
<br>Adam to Tony: “No, not really. It’s been awhile.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “She said that if you washed the black and white off of the pandas, they would just be normal bears again.”
<br>Carl to Tony and Adam: “I spent so long trying to figure out how much soap you would need to do pull that off.”
<br>Tony to Carl: “I figured it out a while ago. You wouldn’t use soap, idiot.”
<br>Adam to Tony: “Don’t call Carl an idiot.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “But he is one.”
<br>Adam to Tony: “So, you are too.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “I know, I get it. Jesus.”
<br>Adam to Tony: “You know what you have to do to keep her from leaving you again. You just can’t do it.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “I don’t know…”
<br>Adam to Tony: “You do know, but you keep pushing it away because you failed to do it thousands of times.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “I don’t know what you’re talking about…”
<br>Adam to Tony: “Stop kidding yourself. You know it deep inside.”
<br>Tony and Adam: “There isn’t anything deep inside.”
<br>Adam to Tony: “Stop with the fucking teenage angst for one second and just admit to yourself already.”
<br>Tony and Adam: “What the fuck do you want me to admit?!”
<br>Adam to Tony: “You know what. Stop FUCKING denying it Tony!”
<br>Tony to Adam: “I DON’T FUCKING KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ADAM!”
<br>Adam to Tony: “JUST FUCKING SAY IT TONY!”
<br>Tony to Adam: I DON’T WANT TO!
<br>Adam to Tony: SAY IT!
<br>Tony to Adam: NO!
<br>Adam to Tony: FINE! I’LL SAY IT THEN! YOU FAILED TONY! YOU FUCKING FAILED. YOU FAILED TO BECOME BETTER FOR HER!”
<br>Tony to Adam: “AND YOU STILL HAVEN’T FUCKING BECOME BETTER FOR YOURSELF!”
<br>Adam is silent.
<br>Adam starts to cry.
<br>Carl walks over to Adam and hands him his glass of orange juice.
<br>Adam smiles a bit, sips some of the juice, and looks at Carl.
<br>Adam to Carl: “I still like the red straw more.”
<br>Carl to Adam: “Guess that’s something that never changes huh.”
<br>Adam smirks.
<br>Adam to Tony: “You, me, Carl, we’re all the same person. And one day you will be where I’m at. And you’re right. I haven’t become better. Because one day you’re going to wake up and realize, years after you’ve lost her, that she was never the main problem. Sure, she was a lot of problems. But she was never the biggest one.”
<br>Tony to Adam: “…What is then?”
<br>Adam looks at Tony, then at Carl, then back at Tony.
<br>Adam to Tony: “The three of us.”
